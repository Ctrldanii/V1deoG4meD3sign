//My game is solitaire. It requires intricate attention and critical thinking in order to complete the game. This sharpens your thinking skills as well as your problmem solving skills.
//You can play it alone as a way to pass time or you can play it with friends and have fun. I would reccomend this game because it is educational and fun
