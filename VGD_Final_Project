The original concept of my game was a first person shooter game, but with modifications, it was meant to be a time travel game. The different levels were going to be different parts of the world as well as a different timeline. 

The name of the game was going to be Aeon's Drift.

Level 1 - get past 2 robots who continuously shoot until you kill them off. once the robot is dead, you can add on yo your life by running past the "+" floater
Level 2 - for competition, you have an even larger robot with obviously larger laser power. the setup consists of walls for protection as the robot rotates as you move. around you, there would be health signs as you work through the level. 
*These 2 levels are in a space like environment

Disclaimer - if you lose, you have to start all over again for it doesn't respawn you back to the original level you were at.

I am proud of how I was able to make the game more challenging in the second level. I created an even bigger robot with bigger power that made the game more engaging

Like I said, this is an old game and due to some technical difficulties with visual studio and unity editor, I wasn't able to make much changes. The main issues I faced was being able to add new sections within the game as well as extending the levels. Sadly, these were issues I couldn't overcome.
[sorry for procrastinating... never again]
